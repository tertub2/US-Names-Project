# US Names Project

Whether you're looking to keep up with the latest baby name trends or avoid commonly used names, government lists of baby names offer a wealth of information and inspiration for parents. This study will utilize open data on Popular Baby Names provided by the United States Social Security Administration (SSA) to uncover valuable insights about baby names in the US.

Selecting a name for a baby is a significant decision that can greatly influence the child's life, so it's important to choose thoughtfully. As Sadity et al. (2007) suggest, cultural diversity has led to a wide range of naming traditions and names have been used to convey creativity, personality, cultural identity, and values.

Are you interested in a trendy name that's currently popular? Do you prefer a common name or do you want something that's truly unique (but not so unusual that it's prohibited)? And if you choose a unique name, how do you ensure that it won't become a popular choice in the coming years? These are some of the questions addressed in this study.

The US Social Security Administration provides data files, one for each year, that contain the total number of births for each gender and name combination wit this in mind, this study utilized this data on male and female names from 1920 to 2020 using jupyther notebook to integrate with the database created in postgresql.
